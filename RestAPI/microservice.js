1. What are microservices ?
Ans. In micro service architecture each application is composed of many smaller,
    loosly coupled and independently deployable services.

    -> Microservices are a software architecture pattern in which complex applications
    are decomposed into small, independent and loosly coupled services.
            Each service is built around a specific business capabilities and can be 
    deployed, developed and scaled independently. These services communicate with each 
    other through well defined API's, typically over a network.



2. How does microservices work ?
Ans. Microservice architecture works by decomposing a complex application into smaller,
    independent services that can be developed, deployed and scaled independently.
    These services communicate with each other through well-defined API's or protocols.



3. How to connect multiple projects in one microservice ?
Ans. Connecting multiple projects in a microservice architecture typicaly involves
    establishing communication channels between the services.
    1) Restful API
    2) Messaging systems
    3) Event driven architecture
    4) API gateways
    5) Shared databases



4. Difference between monolithic and microservice based architecture ?
Ans. Monolithic:- Monolithic architecture is built as one large system and is usually
                one code base. It is not easy to scale based on demand. It has shared
                database.

    Microservices:- Microservices architecture is built as small independent module
                based on business functionality. It is easy to scale based on demand.
                Each project and module has their own database
