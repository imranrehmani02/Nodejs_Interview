1. What is API ?
Ans. API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols
    that allows different software applications to communicate and intract with each other.




2. What is RestAPI or Restful API ?
Ans. A Restful API is an architectural style for an API that uses HTTP request to access
    and use data. That data can be used to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data types, which
    refers to the creating, reading, updating and deleting for operations.



3. Difference b/w API and RestAPI ?
Ans. API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software application to
    communicate with each other. On the other hand Rest API is a specific type of API
    that follows the priciples of Rest Architectural Style.



4. Why we use RestAPI's ?
Ans. RestAPI's offer a simple, scalable and widely supported approach to building distributed
    systems, enabling seemless integration between different applications and platforms.

    - Simplicity and ease of use
    - Platform Independent
    - Scalability and Performance
    - Client Server Separation



5. How to validate API's ?
Ans. Validating API's involves ensuring that the APIs function correctly, return expected
    responses and adhere to be defined specifications.

    1) Review API documentation
    2) Test API endpoints
    3) Verify Input Validation
    4) Test Authentication and Authorization
    5) Test Error Handling
    6) Test Performance and Scalability
    7) Monitor Response time
    8) API Versioning
    9) Security Testing
    10) Documentation Validation



6. What is web socket ?
Ans. Web socket is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels
    over a single, long-lived connection between a client and a server. Unlike traditional HTTP,
    which is request-response protocol, web socket allows for real-time, two way communication
    between the client and the server.

    Key aspects:
    1) Persistent connection
    2) Full duplex communication
    3) Lower listing
    4) Light weight
    5) Wide browser support
    6) Usage scenerios



7. Difference between RestAPI and Websocket ?
Ans. Rest API:- 
        1) It is a stateless protocol. It will not store the data.
        2) It is a request-response model.
        3) It is unidirectional only. Either server or client will communicate.
        4) HTTP request contains header like head section, title section.
        5) New TCP connection will be setup for each HTTP request.
        6) It depends upto the HTTP methods to retrieve the data.

    Web socket:-
        1) It is stateful protocol. It will store the data.
        2) It will full duplex model.
        3) IT is bidirectional.
        4) It is suitable for real-time applications. It does not have any over head.
        5) Only TCP connection.
        6) It depends upon the IP address and PORT number to retrieve the data.
