Q. What is MongoDB shell (mongosh) ?
Ans. The MongoDB Shell, mongosh, is a fully functional JavaScript and Node.js 
    REPL environment for interacting with MongoDB deployments. You can use the
    MongoDB Shell to test queries and operations directly with your database.



Q. What is database sharding ?
Ans. Database sharding is the process of storing a large database across multiple 
    machines. A single machine, or database server, can store and process only a 
    limited amount of data. Database sharding overcomes this limitation by splitting 
    data into smaller chunks, called shards, and storing them across several database servers.
        All database servers usually have the same underlying technologies, and they 
    work together to store and process large volumes of data.



Q. What is sharding in mongodb ?
Ans. Sharding is a method for distributing data across multiple machines. MongoDB uses 
    sharding to support deployments with very large data sets and high throughput operations.
                Database systems with large data sets or high throughput applications 
    can challenge the capacity of a single server.



Q. What is Mongodb charts ?
Ans. MongoDB Charts is a tool to create visual representations of your MongoDB data. 
                Data visualization is a key component to providing a clear understanding
    of your data, highlighting correlations between variables and making it easy to
    discern patterns and trends within your dataset.
